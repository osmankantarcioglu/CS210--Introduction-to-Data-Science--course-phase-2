 The objective of the second phase of the project is to undertake a comprehensive statistical analysis by using two distinct datasets, with the aim of deriving meaningful conclusions.

At the end of these three stages, the goal is to determine if there's a connection between the daily number of new COVID-19 cases and the daily price of Netflix stock.
